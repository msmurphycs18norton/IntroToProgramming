## Data Structures

This module provides an introduction to data structures in Python, focusing on tuples, lists, and dictionaries. It covers how to create, access, and manipulate these data structures to store and manage data efficiently.

### Key Concepts:

- What are tuples?
- How to create tuples?
- Accessing elements in a tuple.
- Immutability of tuples.
- Common tuple operations (indexing, slicing, etc.).
- What are lists, and how are they different from tuples?
- Creating lists.
- Accessing and modifying list elements.
- List methods (append, remove, sort, etc.).
- List comprehensions.
- What are dictionaries?
- Creating dictionaries.
- Accessing and modifying dictionary elements.
- Dictionary methods (keys, values, items, etc.).
- Using dictionaries for various data operations.

### Outcomes:

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of tuples and their immutability.
- Create and manipulate lists, using various list methods and comprehensions.
- Understand the differences between lists and tuples.
- Create and use dictionaries to store and access data.
- Apply dictionary methods for effective data operations.

### Guiding Questions:

Consider the following questions as you review the learning resources:

- When would you choose a tuple over a list for storing data?
- How do the immutability of tuples and the mutability of lists impact their usage?
- In what scenarios are dictionaries more useful than lists or tuples?
