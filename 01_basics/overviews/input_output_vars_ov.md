## Input, Output, and Variables

This module introduces students to the basics of input, output, and variable handling in programming. It covers fundamental concepts like print statements, variable assignment, data types, casting, arithmetic operations, and accepting user input.

### Key Concepts:

- What is a print statement and how do we use it to display information?
- How do we assign values to variables using the `=` symbol?
- What are the different data types in programming (Strings, Integers, Floats, Bool, None)?
- How can we cast or convert data types (e.g., numbers to strings and vice versa)?
- What are F-strings and how do they simplify string formatting?
- How do we perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation)?
- What are compound assignment operators (`+=`, `*=`, `/=`, `-=`)?
- How do we accept input from users in a program?

### Outcomes:

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

- Use print statements to output information to the console.
- Assign values to variables and understand the significance of the `=` symbol.
- Identify and utilize various data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans, None).
- Perform type casting between different data types.
- Format strings using F-strings for clear and concise output.
- Execute basic arithmetic operations and use compound assignment operators.
- Write programs that accept and process user input from the console.

### Guiding Questions:

Consider the following questions as you review the learning resources this week:

- Why is it important to understand different data types in programming?
- How can casting data types be useful in a program?
- When might you use compound assignment operators in your code?

### Possible Lessons:

- Build a command line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations and handle different data types.
