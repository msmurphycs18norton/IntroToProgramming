# üîÅ Understanding For Loops in Python

<!--
- Introduction to for loops in Python.
-->

---

# üîÑ What is a For Loop?

- A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string).
- It's great for when you know the number of iterations in advance.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

<!--
- Mention that the for loop iterates over a sequence.
- Explain that `range(5)` generates numbers from 0 to 4.
- The loop prints each number.
-->

---

# üåÄ What is "Iteration"?

- Iteration means repeating a process.
- In programming, it's the repetition of a block of code.

```python
for char in "hello":
    print(char)
```

<!--
- Define iteration simply.
- Show how each character in the string "hello" is printed one by one.

# üîç For vs. While 

- For loops: Ideal for iterating over a sequence when the number of iterations is known.
- While loops: Better for situations where the number of iterations isn't known in advance.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

<!--
- Contrast the use cases for for loops and while loops.
- Both examples do the same thing, but one uses a for loop and the other uses a while loop.
