# ðŸŒ€ Understanding While Loops in Python

<!--
- Introduction to while loops in Python.
-->

---

# ðŸ¤” What is a While Loop?

- A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true.
- It's great for when you don't know in advance how many times you need to repeat an action.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

<!--
- Explain that the loop starts with `i` equal to 1.
- Each iteration checks if `i` is less than or equal to 5.
- `i` is incremented by 1 each time.
- The loop stops when `i` becomes 6.
-->

---

# ðŸ§© Understanding Syntax

- While loop syntax:

```python
while condition:
    # code block
```
---
# ðŸ›  Example
- The code block inside the loop runs repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Hello!")
    count += 1
```

<!--
- Show the general structure of a while loop.
- Explain that the condition is checked before each iteration.
- The loop prints "Hello!" three times.

# ðŸ”„ While vs. If 

- A while is like an if that keeps checking the condition until it's false.
- If runs once if the condition is true, while keeps running.

```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
if i <= 5:
    print(i)
```

<!--
- Highlight that the if statement checks the condition once.
- Emphasize that the while loop continues checking and executing until the condition is false.
