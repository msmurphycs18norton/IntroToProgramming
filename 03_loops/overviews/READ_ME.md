## Loops Module Overview

This module provides an in-depth look into loops, focusing on while loops and for loops. It covers the concept of iteration, different loop constructs, and practical applications through the creation of a command-line calculator.

### Key Concepts:

- What is a while loop?
- How is a while loop similar to an if statement that keeps going?
- Understanding loop syntax
- What is a for loop?
- What is "iteration"?
- Differences between for loops and while loops
- Looping over:
  - `range()`
    - What is this function and how does it work?
    - Using `range(start, stop, step)`
  - Strings
    - Iterating through all characters in a string
  - Lists
    - What is a list and how to create a hard-coded list
- Circuit breakers in loops:
  - Using `break`
  - Using `continue`
- Creating a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) application using while loops

### Outcomes:

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

- Understand and implement while loops and for loops
- Differentiate between while loops and for loops
- Use the `range()` function effectively in loops
- Iterate through characters in a string and items in a list
- Implement circuit breakers like `break` and `continue` within loops
- Build a command-line calculator using while loops

### Guiding Questions:

Consider the following questions as you review the learning resources this week:

- How does a while loop operate differently than a for loop?
- In what scenarios would you use a while loop instead of a for loop?
- How can using `break` and `continue` within loops enhance your code logic?
