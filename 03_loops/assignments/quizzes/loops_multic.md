1. What is a while loop?

a) A loop that runs a fixed number of times

*b) A loop that repeats as long as a condition is true 

c) A loop that iterates over a sequence

d) A loop that never stops

2. How is a while loop similar to an if statement?

a) Both check a condition only once

b) Both are used for iterating over lists

*c) Both check a condition, but a while loop keeps checking until it's false 

d) Both are used to define functions

3. Which of the following is the correct syntax for a while loop?

a) while(condition) { # code block }

b) while condition do # code block done

*c) while condition: # code block 

d) loop while condition # code block end

4. What is a for loop?

a) A loop that repeats as long as a condition is true

*b) A loop that runs a fixed number of times 

c) A loop that never stops

d) A loop that is used only for strings

5. What does "iteration" mean in programming?

a) Defining a variable

*b) Repeating a block of code 

c) Declaring a function

d) Assigning a value

6. What is a key difference between for loops and while loops?

*a) For loops iterate a fixed number of times, while while loops iterate as long as a condition is true 

b) For loops are faster than while loops

c) While loops iterate a fixed number of times, while for loops iterate as long as a condition is true

d) For loops can only be used with numbers

7. What does the `range()` function do?

a) Generates a list of strings

*b) Generates a sequence of numbers 

c) Iterates over a dictionary

d) Stops a loop

8. How would you use `range(start, stop, step)` to generate even numbers between 2 and 10?

*a) range(2, 10, 2) 

b) range(2, 10)

c) range(2, 10, 1)

d) range(2, 12, 2)

9. How do you iterate through all characters in a string?

*a) for char in "string": 

b) while char in "string":

c) for i in range(len("string")):

d) for each char in "string":

10. What is a list in Python?

a) An unordered collection of items

b) A collection of items that cannot be changed

*c) An ordered collection of items 

d) A single value

11. What does the `break` statement do in a loop?

a) Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one

*b) Exits the loop immediately 

c) Restarts the loop

d) Ends the program

12. What is a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop)?

a) A loop that prints numbers

*b) A loop that reads user input, evaluates it, and prints the result 

c) A loop that runs a fixed number of times

d) A loop that iterates over a string
