1. Which of the following describe a while loop?

[*] Repeats as long as a condition is true

[ ] Runs a fixed number of times

[*] Checks the condition before each iteration

[ ] Iterates over a sequence

2. How is a while loop similar to an if statement?

[*] Both check a condition

[*] Both can execute a block of code

[ ] Both iterate over sequences

[ ] Both are only used for numerical operations

3. Which of the following are correct while loop syntaxes?

[*] while condition:
    # code block

[ ] while(condition) { # code block }

[*] while condition:
    pass

[ ] while: condition

4. Which of the following describe a for loop?

[*] Iterates over a sequence

[*] Runs a fixed number of times

[ ] Repeats as long as a condition is true

[ ] Never stops

5. Which of the following define "iteration" in programming?

[*] Repeating a block of code

[ ] Declaring a variable

[*] Looping through elements in a collection

[ ] Assigning values

6. Which of the following are key differences between for loops and while loops?

[*] For loops are used when the number of iterations is known

[*] While loops are used when the number of iterations is not known

[ ] For loops run indefinitely

[ ] While loops are faster

7. Which of the following correctly describe the `range()` function?

[*] Generates a sequence of numbers

[*] Can define a start, stop, and step

[ ] Generates a list of strings

[ ] Stops a loop

8. How would you use `range(start, stop, step)` to generate even numbers between 2 and 10?

[*] range(2, 10, 2)

[ ] range(2, 10)

[ ] range(2, 10, 1)

[*] range(2, 12, 2)

9. Which of the following show how to iterate through all characters in a string?

[*] for char in "string":

[*] for char in "hello":
    print(char)

[ ] while char in "string":

[ ] for each char in "string":

10. Which of the following describe a list in Python?

[*] An ordered collection of items

[ ] An unordered collection of items

[*] Can contain different data types

[ ] A single value

11. Which of the following describe the `break` statement in a loop?

[*] Exits the loop immediately

[ ] Skips the current iteration

[*] Can be used to stop an infinite loop

[ ] Restarts the loop

12. Which of the following describe a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop)?

[*] Reads user input

[*] Evaluates the input

[*] Prints the result

[ ] Runs a fixed number of times
