1. Why is the DRY principle important?

a) It makes code harder to read.

b) It increases redundancy.

*c) It makes code easier to maintain.

d) It makes code longer.

2. What is a function in programming?

a) A variable that stores data.

*b) A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

c) A comment in the code.

d) An error message.

3. How do you define a basic function in Python?

*a) Using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

b) Using the `func` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

c) Using the `function` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

d) Using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and curly braces.

4. How do you call a function in Python?

a) Using the `call` keyword followed by the function name.

*b) By writing the function name followed by parentheses.

c) By writing the function name followed by curly braces.

d) By writing the function name followed by square brackets.

5. Which of the following is NOT a component of a function?

a) Name

b) Parameters

*c) Loops

d) Return statement

6. What is the difference between parameters and arguments in a function?

a) Parameters are actual values passed to the function, and arguments are variables in the function definition.

*b) Parameters are variables in the function definition, and arguments are actual values passed to the function.

c) Parameters and arguments are the same.

d) Parameters are optional, but arguments are mandatory.

7. Why does the order of positional arguments matter?

*a) Because arguments are matched to parameters based on their position.

b) Because arguments can be passed in any order.

c) Because the function will not execute without a specific order.

d) Because it defines the function's return type.

8. How do keyword arguments provide flexibility?

a) They enforce a strict order of arguments.

*b) They allow arguments to be passed in any order using parameter names.

c) They disable the use of positional arguments.

d) They do not require arguments to be passed at all.

9. What is the purpose of default values for function arguments?

a) To make the function mandatory.

b) To increase the complexity of the function.

c) To define the return type of the function.

*d) To allow parameters to have a default value if no argument is provided.

10. How do you specify type hints for function arguments and return types in Python?

a) By using the `type` keyword before the function definition.

b) By using comments inside the function.

*c) By using a colon after the parameter and an arrow before the return type.

d) By using double colons before the function definition.

11. Why is it important to document functions with docstrings?

a) To make the code run faster.

b) To avoid using comments.

c) To enforce type hints.

*d) To provide clear descriptions of what the function does and its parameters.

12. Which of the following is an example of a docstring in Python?

a) `# This is a docstring`

*b) `"""This is a docstring"""` 

c) `// This is a docstring`

d) `'This is a docstring'`
