1. Why is the DRY principle important?

[ ] It makes code harder to read.

[*] It makes code easier to maintain.

[*] It reduces redundancy.

[ ] It makes code longer.

2. What is a function in programming?

[*] A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

[ ] A variable that stores data.

[*] A way to organize code logically.

[ ] An error message.

3. How do you define a basic function in Python?

[*] Using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

[ ] Using the `func` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

[*] Including a colon at the end of the function header.

[ ] Using the `define` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

4. How do you call a function in Python?

[*] By writing the function name followed by parentheses.

[ ] Using the `call` keyword followed by the function name.

[*] Including any necessary arguments within the parentheses.

[ ] By writing the function name followed by curly braces.

5. Which of the following are components of a function?

[*] Name

[*] Parameters

[ ] Loops

[*] Return statement

6. What is the difference between parameters and arguments in a function?

[*] Parameters are variables in the function definition.

[*] Arguments are actual values passed to the function.

[ ] Parameters are always optional.

[ ] Arguments are defined within the function body.

7. Why does the order of positional arguments matter?

[*] Because arguments are matched to parameters based on their position.

[ ] Because the function will not execute without a specific order.

[*] Because the function expects arguments in a specific sequence.

[ ] Because it defines the function's return type.

8. How do keyword arguments provide flexibility?

[ ] They enforce a strict order of arguments.

[*] They allow arguments to be passed in any order using parameter names.

[ ] They disable the use of positional arguments.

[*] They improve code readability and clarity.

9. What is the purpose of default values for function arguments?

[ ] To make the function mandatory.

[ ] To increase the complexity of the function.

[*] To allow parameters to have a default value if no argument is provided.

[*] To make functions more versatile and user-friendly.

10. How do you specify type hints for function arguments and return types in Python?

[ ] By using the `type` keyword before the function definition.

[*] By using a colon after the parameter and an arrow before the return type.

[*] To improve code readability and catch errors early.

[ ] By using comments inside the function.

11. Why is it important to document functions with docstrings?

[ ] To make the code run faster.

[*] To provide clear descriptions of what the function does and its parameters.

[*] To help other developers understand the code.

[ ] To enforce type hints.

12. Which of the following are examples of a docstring in Python?

[ ] `# This is a docstring`

[*] `"""This is a docstring"""`

[ ] `// This is a docstring`

[*] `'This is a docstring'`
