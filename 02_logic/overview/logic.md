# Logic Module

This module provides an introduction to logical expressions and their application in programming. It covers the use of comparison operators, logical keywords, and the construction of if statements.

## Key Concepts

- What are comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, <=, >=)?
- How do logical expressions use the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not`?
- What is Boolean math?
- How do we use the order of operations to solve compound logical expressions?
- How is `and` equivalent to multiplication in Boolean math?
- How is `or` equivalent to addition in Boolean math?
- What are if statements, and how do we use the keywords `if`, `elif`, and `else`?

## Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of comparison operators and their usage in logical expressions.
- Apply logical keywords (`and`, `or`, `not`) to form complex logical expressions.
- Perform Boolean math operations and understand their real-world applications.
- Construct and analyze compound logical expressions using the correct order of operations.
- Write and implement if statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

## Guiding Questions

Consider the following questions as you review the learning resources this week:

- When should you use comparison operators in your code?
- How do the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` affect the outcome of a logical expression?
- In what scenarios would you use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of a program?
